This repository presents the codes, data and results described in the paper
- A. Bolufe-Rohler and Y. Yuan, Machine Learning for Determining the TransitionPoint in Hybrid Metaheuristics. IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2021.

This repository contains: 
 - The code for creating the dataset for training the classifiers and the dataset.
 - The optimization algorithms using the trained models for predicting the transition point and two models (Decision Tree and SVM) 
 - Some optimization results and an extended analysis of the results.
